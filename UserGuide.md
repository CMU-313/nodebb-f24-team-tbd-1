User Documentation

Create a new file UserGuide.md in the root directory of your repository
In this file, provide a detailed outline of how to use and user test your new feature(s)
You should also provide a link/description of where your added automated tests can be found, along with a description of what is being tested and why you believe the tests are sufficient for covering the changes that you have made
